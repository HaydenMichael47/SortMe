Objective:

Take a file with lines of different words and sort them first by length, followed by alphabetically.
The program should automatically read the file and output the sorted file.
The SortMeRun file is used to automate the testing process.

Constraints:

Each file must stay within the same directory, and each file can't be renamed.

How to run:

To run, make sure that you are in the same directory in the command line or the shell.
In Linux, type 'sh SortMeRun.sh'
In Windows, type 'bash SortMeRun.sh'
To change test data, simply open the 'Sort Me.txt' file and modify the input data, then save before closing.
