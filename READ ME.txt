Objective:

Take a file with lines of different words and sort them first by length, followed by alphabetically.
Alternatively, the reverse option will do the sort and reverse the order.
The program should automatically read the file and output the sorted file.
The SortMeRun file is used to automate the testing process.

Constraints:

Each file must stay within the same directory, and each file can't be renamed.
Do not add any file named 'tmpFile.txt' to the directory. Running the test files will overwrite the data inside and delete the file afterwards.

How to run:

To run, make sure that you are in the same directory in the command line or the shell.
In Linux, double click the file SortMeRun.sh or type 'sh SortMeRun.sh' to run the regular sort
Alternatively, double click the file SortMeRunReverse.sh or type 'sh SortMeRunReverse.sh' to run the reverse sort

In Windows, double click the file SortMeRun.bat or type 'bash SortMeRun.sh' to run the regular sort
Alternatively, double click the file SortMeRunReverse.bat or type 'bash SortMeRunReverse.sh' to run the reverse sort
To change test data, simply open the 'Sort Me.txt' file and modify the input data, then save before closing.

How to run a test:

Double click the file 'SortMeRunTest' to test the normal sort function
If there are any errors, the results will specify, otherwise it will say that the sort has passed.

Double click the file 'SortMeRunReverseTest' to test the reverse sort function
If there are any errors, the results will specify, otherwise it will say that the sort has passed.
